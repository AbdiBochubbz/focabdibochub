  <h1 style="font-family:jokerman; text-align:center;">	Software Engineering </h1>
   <p></p>

    <p style="font-family:courier; text-align:center;">
	Software engineering is the branch of computer science that seeks principles to
guide the development of large, complex software systems. The problems faced
when developing such systems are more than enlarged versions of those problems
faced when writing small programs. For instance, the development of such
systems requires the efforts of more than one person over an extended period of
time during which the requirements of the proposed system may be altered and
the personnel assigned to the project may change. Consequently, software engineering
includes topics such as personnel and project management that are
more readily associated with business management than computer science.
    </p>
	 <h3 style="font-family:jokerman; text-align:center;">The Software Life Cycle</h3>
	<p style="font-family:courier; text-align:center;">
The most fundamental concept in software engineering is the software life cycle. 
Once software is developed, it enters a cycle of being used and maintained—acycle 
that continues for the rest of the software’s life. The maintenance phase tends to consist of correcting or
updating.

	 <h3 style="font-family:jokerman; text-align:center;">The Traditional Development Phase</h3>
	<p style="font-family:courier; text-align:center;">
The major steps in the traditional software development life cycle are requirements
analysis, design, implementation, and testing.

	</p>
	
	
	<h5 style="font-family:jokerman; text-align:center;">Requirements Analysis</h5>
	<p style="font-family:courier; text-align:center;">
The software life cycle begins with requirements analysis—
the goal of which is to specify what services the proposed system will provide, to
identify any conditions (time constraints, security, and so on) on those services,
and to define how the outside world will interact with the system.
</p>
	<p style="font-family:courier; text-align:center;">
In any case, the requirements analysis process consists of compiling and
analyzing the needs of the software user; negotiating with the project’s stakeholders
over trade-offs between wants, needs, costs, and feasibility; and finally
developing a set of requirements that identify the features and services that the
finished software system must have. These requirements are recorded in a document
called a software requirements specification. The following is our software requirements specification.

	</p>
	
	<h5 style="font-family:jokerman; text-align:center;">Design</h5>
	<p style="font-family:courier; text-align:center;">
Design involves creating a plan for the construction of the
proposed system. Design is about developing a solution to the problem.
It is in the design stage that the internal structure of the software system is
established. The result of the design phase is a detailed description of the software
system’s structure that can be converted into programs.
	</p>
	<h5 style="font-family:jokerman; text-align:center;">Implementation</h5>
	<p style="font-family:courier; text-align:center;">
Implementation involves the actual writing of programs, creation
of data files, and development of databases. It is at the implementation stage that
we see the distinction between the tasks of a software analyst (sometimes
referred to as a system analyst) and a programmer. The former is a person
involved with the entire development process, perhaps with an emphasis on the
requirements analysis and design steps. The latter is a person involved primarily
with the implementation step.
	</p>
	
	<h5 style="font-family:jokerman; text-align:center;">Testing</h5>
	<p style="font-family:courier; text-align:center;">
Testing is essentially equated with the process of debugging programs and confirming that the final
software product was compatible with the software requirements specification.
The elimination of errors is one of the goals of software
engineering.
